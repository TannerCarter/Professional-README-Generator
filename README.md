# Description

The README Generator I created was not as difficult as other projects, but it was strenuous when it came down to git this time around - due to a lot of merging conflicts I had messed up on.
The README Generator is still a work in progress for me, as I'd like to add badges showcasing the languages I used for the any upcoming challenges and or projects. Besides this additional, the readme should follow all the given requirements.
I look forward to using node a lot more in the upcoming weeks.
